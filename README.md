# Greetings, Star Travelers! 🌠 I'm Timy

![Python Enthusiast](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

## Who Dis?
- **Role:** Python Padawan / DIY Tinkerer / Space-Time Procrastinator
- **Location:** Orbiting around Earth, probably near a WiFi signal.

## What's Cooking in My Python Pot?
- 🐍 **Python:** My main squeeze, although I'm still learning not to get squeezed back. 
- 🔧 **DIY Projects:** Currently turning an old ice maker into a DIY AC - because why not control the climate?

## Hobbies That Keep Me From Actual Hobbies:
- 🎮 **Gaming:** Where my strategic procrastination skills truly shine.
- 🌐 **IT/Networking:** Big fan of Ubiquiti gear; if my network were a starship, it'd be the Enterprise.
- 🛠️ **Building Things:** From code to coolers, if it can be made, I'll try not to break it... much.
- 😴 **Being Lazy:** An art form I've nearly perfected.

## Current Projects:
- **Operation Cool Down:** That DIY AC isn't going to build itself, unfortunately.
- **Scripting Shenanigans:** Little Python scripts that do big things, or at least, they try.

## Tech Stack:
```plaintext
- Python (I'm like at the 'Hello, World!' stage, but with more errors)
- Git (Because even I need to undo my life choices sometimes)
